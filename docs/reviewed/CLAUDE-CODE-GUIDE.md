## 🚀 Setting Up Claude Code

### **Step 1: Install Claude Code**

**Via NPM** (Recommended):
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Verify Installation:**
```bash
claude-code --version
```

### **Step 2: Authenticate**

```bash
claude-code login
```

This will:
1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to log in to Claude
3. Grant access to Claude Code
4. Save credentials locally

### **Step 3: Initialize in Your Project**

Navigate to your project:
```bash
cd /path/to/world-papers-nextjs
```

Initialize Claude Code:
```bash
claude-code init
```

This creates a `.claude` directory with configuration.

---

## 📦 Migrating Your Project

### **Step 1: Commit Current Work**

Before switching, commit everything:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Pre Claude Code migration - working state"
```

### **Step 2: Create Claude Code Configuration**

**File: `.claude/config.json`**
```json
{
  "project": "world-papers",
  "language": "typescript",
  "framework": "nextjs",
  "includes": [
    "app/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "components/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
    "lib/**/*.ts",
    "scripts/**/*.ts"
  ],
  "excludes": [
    "node_modules/**",
    ".next/**",
    "dist/**",
    "*.log"
  ],
  "context": {
    "readme": "README.md",
    "documentation": ["docs/**/*.md"],
    "plan": "docs/PRODUCTION-PLAN.md"
  }
}
```

### **Step 3: Create Claude Instructions**

**File: `.claude/instructions.md`**
```markdown
# World Papers - Claude Code Instructions

## Project Context
This is a Next.js 14 application for World Papers, a global digital policy analysis platform.

## Current Phase
Following PRODUCTION-PLAN.md - currently in Phase [X], Day [Y]

## Key Files
- Main page: app/page.tsx
- Components: components/ui/*
- Database: lib/supabase.ts
- Mock data: lib/mockData.ts

## Development Guidelines
1.  **TypeScript First**: Use strict TypeScript. All functions and components must have explicit types. Avoid `any`.
2.  **Component Structure**: Create new components in `components/`. UI-specific, reusable components go in `components/ui/`.
3.  **State Management**: For simple state, use React Hooks (`useState`, `useReducer`). For complex global state, discuss before implementing.
4.  **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS utility classes exclusively. Do not write inline styles or separate CSS files.
5.  **Data Fetching**: Use Server Components and `async/await` in `app/` for data fetching. Client-side data fetching should use SWR or React Query if needed.
6.  **Error Handling**: API routes must have robust error handling with meaningful status codes and messages. UI components should handle loading and error states gracefully.
7.  **Environment Variables**: Access environment variables via a validated configuration file, not directly via `process.env`.
8.  **Commits**: Follow conventional commit standards (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`).

## Current Tasks
See PRODUCTION-PLAN.md Day [X] for current objectives

## Testing
Our testing strategy is based on the "Testing Trophy" model. Every new feature or bug fix must be accompanied by tests to validate its correctness and prevent regressions.

### Test Locations
- **Unit Tests:** For individual components or functions. Place them in a `__tests__` directory next to the file (e.g., `components/ui/__tests__/Button.test.tsx`).
- **Integration Tests:** For API routes and pages.
    - API Routes: `app/api/path/__tests__/route.test.ts`
    - Pages: `app/(main)/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
- **Accessibility (a11y) Tests:** Include `jest-axe` checks in component and page tests to ensure no accessibility violations.

### Commands
- `pnpm test`: Run all tests once. This is also run on pre-commit.
- `pnpm test:watch`: Run tests in interactive watch mode during development.
- `pnpm test:coverage`: Run all tests and generate a coverage report.

### Your Task
- When creating a new feature, you **must** create corresponding tests.
- When fixing a bug, you **must** add a test that reproduces the bug and verifies the fix.
- Aim to maintain or increase test coverage with your changes.

## Database
Using Supabase:
- Connection details in .env.local
- Schema in docs/schema.sql
- Seed with scripts/seed.ts
```
