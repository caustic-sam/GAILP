Ok, Claude.  We're gearing up for a pre-public launch to a live domain in 10 days.  Section s that can;t be ready realistically will be hidden with our "fearture flag" utility.  The homepage is looking great but needs polish, the admin functionality is almost acceptable for a pre-public release but not quite there, reliable publishing and creation of content still meassy, etc.

We've made notes. below are some of my outstanding items.  come up with a plan after reading through whastever you need to.

1.  feeds need to work and be updated reliably
2.  custom content (exoert blog) must poluate with imageds reliably
3.  media vault still has issues
4.  post do not accept cutom imsgaes
5.  mouse stramgely does not chage when mousing over buttons or other lnks
6.  We have a drafts auth error
7.  "Loading...." still occurs and we're not sure why.  I have noticed, however, that when the avatar appears the right nav bar changes to show the admin options but not until then
8.  Rght admin nav bar also shows the regular NAV bar along with it.  It should not.
9.  UNder policyn posts some cards are not updating orh have no content.
10. CTReat programmatic check of all liniks - is this good practice?
11. Change  of Expert Blog to THink Tank
12. "Return to articles". ->. DOews not return to articles....again, link validation
13. Live Hub -> Global Service Announcement -> FIreside CHat
14. BOOK: 86ed
15. Can we setup a nomenclature or Taxnomoy
    1.  Homepage
    2.  H.policy-updateas
    3.  H.blog
    4.  H.vidoes 
    5.  H.research (url reads /policies btw)
    6.  A way to demark regular secdev tests 
        1.  

********************
QUESTIONS FOR YOU
Before I start implementation, please clarify:
Live Hub naming: Is the final name "Global Service Announcement" OR "Fireside Chat"? (you mentioned both)
BOOK section: Where is this located? (I didn't find it in navigation - is it a future feature to remove?)
Policy cards: Which specific cards are not updating? All of them or certain jurisdictions?
Admin nav behavior: Should regular nav HIDE when user is admin, or just be visually separated?
Feature flags for launch: Which sections should be HIDDEN on day 1? (videos, policies, articles, etc.?)
URL change: Should I rename /policies → /research to match your taxonomy, or update nav label to "Policies"?
Once you confirm these details, I'll start executing the plan in priority order!
*************************

1.  Let's go with GSA
2.  Froget Book Section - unrelated npte
3.  I was referring to Policy and Regulstion Card, Research and STudies, etc, dont populate with content
4.  disappear.  admins dont need another identical navbar on the right as they have as every oither user on the top
5.  We should have the ability to hide any section to be prepared for hising any section that is not finished enough to present
6.  keep it to /research
